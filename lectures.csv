However, because BLEU computes a geometric mean of n-gram precisions, it often correlates poorly with human judgment on the sentence-level. Therefore, several smoothing techniques havebeen proposed. This paper systematically compares 7 smoothing techniquesfor sentence-level BLEU. Three of themare first proposed in this paper, and theycorrelate better with human judgments onthe sentence-level than other smoothingtechniques. Moreover, we also comparethe performance of using the 7 smoothingtechniques in statistical machine translation tuning.",Définition la plus simple de BLEU !!! + smoothing fonction quand p_{n}=0
